0. OSI model

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.



It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:



The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal

The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc

Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.

In this project we will mainly focus on:



The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP

On the Network layer with IP and ICMP

The image bellow describes more concretely how you can relate to every level.

Questions:



What is the OSI model?



Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
