 TCP and UDP ports

mandatory

Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.



If we continue the comparison of a network device to your house, where IP address is like your postal address, UDP and TCP ports are like the windows and doors of your place. A TCP/UDP network device has 65535 ports. Some of them are officially reserved for a specific usage, some of them are known to be used for a specific usage (but nothing is officially declared) and the rest are free of use.



While the full list of ports should not be memorized, it is important to know the most used ports, letâ€™s start by remembering 3 of them:



22 for SSH

80 for HTTP

443 for HTTPS

Note that a specific IP + port = socket.



Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:



That only shows listening sockets

That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs

Example:
