Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s executed on.



Example:



sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-show_attached_IPs | cat -e

10.0.2.15$

127.0.0.1$

sylvain@ubuntu$

Obviously, the IPs displayed may be different depending on which machine you are running the script on.



Note that we can see our localhost IP :)
