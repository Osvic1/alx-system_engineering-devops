Port listening on localhost

#advanced

Write a Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.



Terminal 0



Starting my script.



sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./100-port_listening_on_localhost

Terminal 1



Connecting to localhost on port 98 using telnet and typing some text.



sylvain@ubuntu$ telnet localhost 98

Trying 127.0.0.2...

Connected to localhost.

Escape character is '^]'.

Hello world

test

Terminal 0



Receiving the text on the other side.



sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./100-port_listening_on_localhost

Hello world

test

For the sake of the exercise, this connection is made entirely within localhost. This isn’t really exciting as is, but we can use this script across networks as well. Try running it between your local PC and your remote server for fun!



As you can see, this can come in very handy in a multitude of situations. Maybe you’re debugging socket connection issues, or you’re trying to connect to a software and you are unsure if the issue is the software or the network, or you’re working on firewall rules… Another tool to add to your debugging toolbox!
